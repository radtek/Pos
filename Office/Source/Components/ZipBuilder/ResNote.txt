        How to Make a New Resource File for Another Language
        ----------------------------------------------------

In the zip project, we use resource files to hold the 
error messages that can be generated.  This lets us support 
other languages without much trouble.

For now, these are the languages that were supported for earlier versions.
In version 1.78 some messages were added that are not yet translated 
into these languages.

For Version 1.78 the English version of the messages is build-in
when compiled with the USE_ALLZIPSTRINGS.

The message that are new for version 1.78 are collected in a separate
file 'ZipNew178.rc'
 
   ZipMsgBR.res - Brazilian (Portuguese)
*   ZipMsgCT.res - Catalan
   ZipMsgDK.res - Danish
*  ZipMsgNL.res - Dutch
   ZipMsgFI.rc  - Finnish
   ZipMsgFR.rc  - French
   ZipMsgDE.res - German
   ZipMsgHU.res - Hungarian
   ZipMsgNO.res - Norwegian
   ZipMsgPT.res - Polish
   ZipMsgSW.rc  - Swedish
*   ZipMsgS1.rc  - Spanish
   ZipMsgSL.res - Slovenian
*  (ZipMsgUS.res - US / English) is no longer needed is build-in.

  ZipMsgCN.res - Chinese [ GB(K) - commonly used in China and Singapore for
                            simplified Chinese writing.]
   ZipMsgCZ.res - Czech
   ZipMsgGR.res - Greek
   ZipMsgIT.res - Italian
   ZipMsgJP.res - Japanese
   ZipMsgMY.res - Malaysia
   ZipMsgRO.rc  - Romanian
   ZipMsgRU.res - Russian
   ZipMsgYU.res - Serbian (Yugoslavia)

                             traditional Chinese writing.]

*) These files are complete


We would like YOU to help us by porting the error messages
from English into another language that we don't support yet.

The files ZipMsg.h holds the resource Id numbers, and ZipMsgUS.rc
holds the source for the English text (error/warning) messages.

ZipNew178.rc holds the source in English for message that are new
in version 1.78

To make a resource file for a new language, follow these
steps:
1) To prevent double work it is a smart thing to ask if the
   translation hasn't been made yet. Sometimes the translation
   is already made but not yet present on the web site or
   included in the DelZip package.

2) Select a 2 letter code for your language
   example: "DE" for German (Deutch)

3) Create a new source file for your messages:
   COPY ZipMsgUS.rc ZipMsgDE.rc

4) Edit your new file - translate the text to your language
   NOTEPAD ZipMsgDE.RC

8) E-mail me your new .RC! Tell me the full name of the new language, 
   and your full name and e-mail address.
   I will refer to your name and address in the help file unless
   you tell me not to.
