The following is a list of all releases of Rave 5.1 as well as the bugs that
were fixed and the features that were added in each release.

5.1.2 - 7/25/03
---------------

=======
Changes
=======

- Changed NDR structure to support reports with greater than 32767 pages.
  As always, Rave 5.1.2 will be backwards compatible with NDRs created with
  previous versions of Rave.

- Changed TDLBaseResultSet.EOF function to Eof to prevent C++Builder conflicts.

- Changed Event Editor compile status label to show errors in red for easier
	reading.

=====
Fixes
=====

- Fixed problem in DataLink drivers where invalid SQL would not report a proper
  error and would sometimes lock up the Rave visual report designer.

- Fixed bug in Event Editor where event source would be cleared for current event
	when switching to page view mode.

- Fixed bug where RPDev.OutputFile property was not being cleared after a print
	job.

- Fixed a problem where in certain instances the text position after center and
  left justified text was not being calculated correctly for non-inch based units.

- Fixed a problem with CLX based text width calculations.

- Fixed a problem where setting the OutputFile/OutputFileName properties would
	not generate native printer file output.

- Fixed a problem where a region placed in a section would only print one page.


5.1.1 - 7/04/03
---------------

=========
Additions
=========

- Added "Test Connection" buttons to database configuration dialogs

- Added command and connection timeout parameters to the ADO datalink driver

- Added SQLRole and read committed settings to the Interbase Express datalink
	driver

- Added new scripting demo project in the Demos\Scripting folder and updated
	the scripting documentation

- Added the Data Viewer project designer to allow the viewing of data of a
	DataView from within the Rave report designer

- Added a page view mode to the Event Editor to view all events defined for any
	component on the current page

- Added the ability to delete events within the Event Editor

- Added a new band component expert that allows for easier creation of header,
	footer and detail bands.  To activate, right click on any band and select
	the "Create" menu

- Added the display of the component name that the mouse is currently hovering
	over to the status bar in the Rave designer

- Added new Language Pack option to the Rave installer to allow the
	installation of French, German or Japanese help files and Rave report
	designer interfaces

- Added the DisableDataSource property the the dataset data connection
	components.  When set to false, the DisableControls/EnableControls will
	not be called in the Open and Restore operations and then the MasterSource
	relationships and other data source related features will then function.
	Note that having visual controls connected to the dataset could drastically
	slow down report speed if this property is set to false.

- Added the RestoreDataSet property to the dataset data connection components.
	When set to false, the data cursor and filter properties will not be saved or
	restored.

- Added code based printing support to the scripting libraries.  Please see the
	scripting demo project for several examples.

- Added the Visible property to most Rave visual components

- Added the OnPrint event to the RaveSection component to allow for code based
	printing within a visually designed report

- Added With statement support to the scripting language

=======
Changes
=======

- Improved event compilation so that it will auto-recompile upon report
	execution if changes had been made since the last compile

- Updated DataLink drivers and DataLink specification to version 2.0 for
	simpler and more robust datalink driver definitions

- Changed About Box so that it now displays both the build number and the
	version

- Changed the developer version of the Rave report designer (Rave.exe) so that
	Delphi does not need to be running to execute (BEX version).  Note that this
	does not change the licensing of the Rave report designer and the developer
	version (Rave.exe) is still not distributable.  For end user report design
	capability please refer the the End User Designer License option.

- Changed the Rave installer so that it defaults to the last location that Rave
	was installed to

- Changed the Rave installer so that the proper redistributable files are
	available in the Rave5\Redist folder (more files were added)

- Changed GUID field types from blob to string

- Changed processing of Report.CurrentPage and Report.RelativePage report
	variables so that they can now be used in calculations or referenced in
	DataMirrorSection field values
