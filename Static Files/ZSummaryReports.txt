#
# This file allows you to create user defined summary report blocks as part of the Z or X reports.
#
# It uses the following general format: "Operand [Name] Options"
#
# e.g 
# "+[EFTPOS]"," +[Cash]" 
# would add the total EFTPOS & Cash sales to the "Transaction Summary Totals" on the Zed.
# 
# Valid Operands are: <> [] # $ {} + - / * 
# <>		Used to set the Report Title, or to set the name for a Payment type. Text must be inside <>.
# [] 		Specifiy the Payment Type by name. Text must be inside <>. Not case sensitive.
# #		Generate a Subtotal for this summary report for all items above since the last subtotal. eg "#<Subtotal>"
# $		Generate a Grand Total for this summary report for all items above
# {Value} 	Overrides the amount (if any) with the amount entered. eg "+{10.00}<Surcharge>" Do NOT include a $ sign
# + - / * 	Add, Subtract, Divide and Multiply with the running total for this section. eg. "+[Group 1]" "-[Group 2]"
#	
# Each line defines a new Transaction Summary block with its own Total.
#
# The entire block description with all its [Operand][Name] pairs must be on a single line.
#
# If you leave off the +-/* in a field the system will ignore that field unless it also has <> text 
# in it in which case it will just add the text.
#
# If the first field contains <> then the text bewteen the <> sets the Report Title for that summary.
# If any other field contains <> then the text sets the Payment name for that field.
#
# eg "<My Special Totals>"," +[Group 1] <Tax Free Group>"," +[Group 2] <Other Group>"," -[Group 3]"
#
# Yes you need the quotes!
#
#
#
# There are some system defined "Names" as follows:
# [Initial Float]
# [Float Adjustments]
# [Change]
# [Cash]
# [Credit]
# [Group <Transaction Group Number>] e.g [Group 0]
# [Vouchers Sold]
# [Vouchers Redeemed]
# [Voucher Movement]
# [Points Sold]
# [Points Redeemed]
# [Points Movement]
# [Tabs Credit Sold]
# [Tabs Credit Redeemed]
# [Tabs Credit Movement]
#
# You can also use names that have been defined as payment types:
# [Payment Name]    e.g [Cheque] or [Visa] or [Rooms]
#
# Or you can create compound types:
# [Payment Name + " Cash Out"]    which becomes   [Eftpos Cash Out].
# 
# 
# 
# Examples...
# "+[Group 0]"," +[Group 1]"," +[Group 2]"     Displays Group 0, Group 1, and Group 2 on successive lines
#
# If you wanted to add in Points Redeemed....
# "+[Group 0]"," +[Group 1]"," +[Group 2]","+[Points Redeemed]"
#
# Warning: You can double dip with this format as follows:
# "+[Group 0]","+[Points Redeemed]","+[Points Sold]"   This would be inaccurate as the money received 
#                                                for the points sold has already been added into Group 0.

#"<EFTPOS Reconciliation>","+[Eftpos]","+[Eftpos Cash Out]","#<EFTPOS total>"

#"<Summary Report>","+[Group 0]","+[Group 1]","#<Sub total>","+[Points Redeemed]","$<Summary Report Total>"
