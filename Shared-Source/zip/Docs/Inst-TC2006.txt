ZipBuilder, for Borland Turbo C++ 2006 Explorer version
Version 1.79
Original  by Chris Vleghert
Latest adaptations by Roger Aelbrecht, Zipbuilder@drehoeksw.net

These instructions are for Turbo C++ 2006 'Explorer' version only. 
If you use the 'Pro' version use the instructions in "Inst-BDS4.txt"

The Explorer version does not allow to add any 3rd party components to 
the IDE, but this does not mean you cannot use TZipBuilder with it.

How do we use it:

One: 
---
build the packages as instructed in "Inst-BDS4.txt" it will all work except
for the last part :

	right click Project Manager - ZBldr179C10.bpl
  	-> Install
  	
 If you click install you will get a message from Turbo C++ telling you  
 that you cannot install 3 rd party packages.
 
 Meanwhile you created the packages we need.
 
Two:
---- 
Open the application were you want to use ZipBuilder. 
In your 'main' source files, just below #pragma package(smart_init)

Add a line 
#pragma link "ZBldr179C10.bpi"

this will make sure that the ZipBuilder package is linked with your project.

Go to the form constructor and add

ZipBuilder1 = new TZipBuilder(this);

Three:
------ 
Open your 'main' header file and add
#include "ZipBuilder.h" to your include files

Then in the form class go to the 'private:' section and add

TZipBuilder* ZipBuilder1;

Off course any other name can be used. 

Four:
----- 

If you want to use a event handler for any of the events, you need to add 
them manually in both the 'main' CPP and header files and connect them to the 
ZipBuilder package by adding something like
ZipBuilder1->OnProgressDetails = ZipBuilder1ProgressDetails;
in the constructor of the form.

Five:
-----
If you have build the packages in the default directory TC2006 will find them,
otherwise you have to make sure that the compiler/linker knows the path

You need to instruct TC2006 were it can find the ZipBuilder.h file there are 
two options for it.

1- Use the global search path (preferred):
	 In TC2006 open 'Options' , select 'Environment Options', then 'C++ Options' 
	 and then 'Paths and Directories' In the right hand part of the dialog click
	 the '...' (Browse) button under 'Search path', In the Directories dialog that
	 is opened now click the Browse (...) button again and browse to 
	 ZipBuilder directory now Click the 'Add' button to add this path to
	 the list and click 2X OK.
	 
	 The path to the ZipBuilder sources is now available for all your projects
	 
 2- Use the project search path
 	In TC2006 open 'Project Options' and select 'Paths and Defines' then click the
 	Edit' button next to 'Include search path' in the dialog that is opened now
 	click the browse (...) button and browse to the ZipBuilder directory 
 	now Click the 'Add' button to add this path to the list and click 2X OK.

                       C++ BUILDER DEMO's
Installation
------------
1.  The CDemo directory has a number of sub directories one for BCB6,
    one for Turbo C++ 2006 specific files, etc. The files that are
    common to all environments are in the CDemoX directory.
    To install a demo you HAVE to COPY the files from the sub
    directory TC2006 to the CDemoX directory. Sometimes you will
    be asked to overwrite an existing file this is NOT an error
    and you should confirm the question.
    
2.  Important:
    You must set the include and library path in your project,
    not only for the demo's but also for new projects.
    How to do this is explain above under 'five' options 1 and 2

                    DESCRIPTION OF DEMO PROJECTS

    Demo1 is a native C++ Builder port of the Delphi Zip Demo 1.
    This is a very complete File Manager type of program that lets
    you create archives, view archives, extract files, etc.  It can
    also turn .zip files into .exe files (and vice-versa).


                  Deployment of Your Programs
                  ---------------------------

From version 1.79 there are two options for the distribution of the
required dll and sfx files.

Option 1:
	You should have your install procedures put these
	files into the WINDOWS SYSTEM directory (which is named differently
	on some systems - especially WinNT systems).  If that isn't 
	possible, then you should put them into the same directory as 
	your .EXE program that uses them.
	
Option 2:
	Include the dll and all or some of the required sfx *.bin's into
	a resource file that can be included into your application.
	See also the information under languages

Of course, there are no distribution fees for the DLL, or
any other part of the package.  This whole package is 
freeware, but does have some minor distribution restrictions
(mainly that you can't profit from the ZIP DLL, and you need
to document where users can get source code).Please see 
README.TXT and LICENSE.TXT for these restrictions.


TZIPBUILDER HELP
================
To have the help files available we offer two solutions:

1- Use the ziphelp.chm:
	Copy the ziphelp.chm file to any folder of your choice 
	(we suggest using "..Program Files\DrehoekSW\ZipBuilder\Help")
	Double click the file and it will be opened in the 
	'Microsoft HTML Help Executable'
	
2- Integrate the Ziphelp into the BDS4 help namespace used by Turbo C++ 2006
	To integrate the ziphelp file we suggest you use H2Reg.exe:
	- Copy all the .Hx? files in the help folder to any folder of your choice 
	 (we suggest using "..Program Files\DrehoekSW\ZipBuilder\Help")
	- Copy the file H2reg.ini to the same folder
	- Copy the H2Reg.exe executable to the same folder. You can find H2Reg.exe in 
		'..Program Files\Borland\BDS\4.0\Help\ThirdParty'
	 	Or you can download it form 
	 	'http://www.helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm'
	- Open a command window and sets its working directory to the help folder
	- Type the command 
	  H2reg -r
	  A little window will report that the registration is executed.
	- When you open your BDS4 C++ personality and start Help it will show a
	 	message box that the changes you requested will be executed. when that is
	 	finished ziphelp is integrated into BDS4 help
